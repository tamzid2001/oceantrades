You warrant that the information you provide us is truthful and accurate, and that you are not impersonating another person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access your OceanTrades user account, and you agree not to transfer your password or user name, or lend or otherwise transfer your use of or access to your user account, to any third party.

Please see Section 20 below for additional information.<br>
                    SECTION 5 &ndash; ORDER PLACEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE<br>
                    If you order a service or product, payment must be received by us before your order is accepted. We may require additional information regarding your order if any required information was missing or inaccurate, and may cancel or limit an order any time after it has been placed. Your electronic order confirmation, or any form of confirmation, does not signify our acceptance of your order. You must contact us immediately at oceantradescommunity@gmail.com in order to modify or cancel your pending order. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to amend your order in accordance with your instructions.<br>
                    All items are subject to availability. We will notify you if any item is not available, the expected availability date, and may offer you an alternative product or service. If the availability of any product or service is delayed and you do not wish to substitute the product or service, upon your request, we will cancel your order and if previously charged, your payment card will be fully refunded for that specific order. We reserve the right to limit the sales of our products and services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis at our sole and exclusive discretion.<br>
                    Your purchase order of products and other services is conditioned on you re-affirming your acceptance of this Agreement.<br>
                    All advertised prices are in, and all payments shall be in, U.S. Dollars.<br>
                    SECTION 6 &ndash; REFUND, AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT &amp; PAYMENT, &amp; CANCELLATION<br>
                    OceanTrades can change the monthly membership subscription rate at any time. If the membership subscription rate changes after you subscribe, we will notify you by email and give you an opportunity to cancel. If you wish to cancel your subscription at any time, you must follow the instructions in the knowledge base article &ldquo;How do I cancel?&rdquo; or live chat us at https://oceantrades.org to request the cancellation. This must be done at least one day before your next subscription due date, or your credit card may still be charged. When canceling your account, you have the option to have the account terminated immediately or by your next due date. There is no pro-rating if you decide to terminate immediately. If you do not cancel at least one day before the next due date, your subscription will automatically continue and the payment card that you provided at the time of enrollment online will be charged the full monthly membership subscription rate provided at the time of enrollment each month until you cancel.<br>
                    We have a thirty (30) day refund policy if you are not happy with the service and you are entitled to a full refund of your start-up payment up until 1 day before your next billing due date. If you do not ask for a refund at least one day before your next due date, OceanTrades will assume you wish to continue with the subscription and charge the regular monthly subscription amount on the due date so you continue with access for the next month. Once the day before your due date has arrived, you will not be entitled to any refund for any payments to OceanTrades.<br>
                    SECTION 7 &ndash; SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT<br>
                    A OceanTrades user is responsible for paying all sums due to OceanTrades in connection with their monthly subscription in accordance with these Terms. The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access.Every calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following month&rsquo;s subscription, together with any other fees for the following month&rsquo;s subscription plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, &ldquo;Fees&rdquo;). Failure by the OceanTrades user to use any of the services available through the service provided by OceanTrades does not relieve the OceanTrades user of their payment obligations under these Terms.<br>
                    Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card. Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due. You further acknowledge and agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (unless the subscription is cancelled in accordance with these Terms) and therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount).<br>
                    IF YOU ARE A OceanTrades USER WITH A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBER OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT. IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO OceanTrades, YOU MAY DO SO THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT DASHBOARD OR BY oceantradescommunity@gmail.com AT LEAST TEN (10) DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH.<br>
                    OceanTrades reserves the right to immediately terminate a user&rsquo;s account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice). Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the event OceanTrades starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in Section 20 below.<br>
                    In addition to any Fees, OceanTrades may also charge applicable value added or other tax.<br>
                    SECTION 8 &ndash; SHIPPING FEES<br>
                    Unless otherwise stated on the Website at the time of purchase, if we ship you a physical product, we reserve the right to add applicable shipping and handling fees to your order. Unless otherwise stated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your order within a reasonable time after receipt of your properly completed and verified order. Accurate shipping address and phone number information is required. Although we may provide delivery or shipment timeframes or dates, such dates are good-faith estimates and are subject to change. If your order will be delayed, we will contact you at the e-mail address you provided when placing your order. If we are unable to contact you or you would like to cancel your order, we will cancel the order and refund the full amount charged. We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by us. The risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to any third party carrier.<br>
                    SECTION 9 &ndash; PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICES AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE<br>
                    Products, services, and prices are generally posted at the following URL, but are subject to change: https://oceantrades.org.

By accessing, using, subscribing or placing an order over the Website, you authorize OceanTrades to charge your account in the amount indicated for the value of the services you select, including any future price changes. If you request a downgrade in services, the downgrade (and corresponding price reduction) will become effective on the first day of the month following your requested downgrade. By your continued use of OceanTrades services, and unless you terminate your subscription as provided herein, you agree that OceanTrades may charge your credit card monthly for the products and services you have selected, and you consent to any price changes for such services after e-mail notice has been provided to you.<br>
                    OceanTrades takes reasonable steps in an effort to ensure that the prices set forth on the Website are correct, and to accurately describe and display the items available on the Website. If the correct price of our product is higher than its stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.<br>
                    When ordering products or services, please note that OceanTrades does not warrant that product or service descriptions are accurate, complete, current, or error-free, or that packaging will match the actual product that you receive. All sales are deemed final except as provided in Section 6 of these Terms. OceanTrades&rsquo;s descriptions of, or references to, products or services not owned by OceanTrades are not intended to imply endorsement of that product or service, or constitute a warranty by OceanTrades.<br>

                    OceanTrades may offer you an opportunity to become an independent OceanTrades Affiliate (&ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo;), wherein you have the opportunity to earn money from commissions for OceanTrades accounts that you sell to other users. Blue Ege Financial reserves the sole and exclusive right to determine the amount of remuneration each Affiliate will receive in exchange for the Affiliate&rsquo;s efforts.<br>
                    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. As an Affiliate and otherwise including without limitation as a OceanTrades user, you must comply with all laws, both U.S. and foreign, including, but not limited to, laws prohibiting deceptive and misleading advertising and marketing, e-mail marketing laws (including the federal CAN-SPAM Act (15 U.S.C. &sect; 7701)), telemarketing laws (including the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. &sect; 227) and the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 C.F.R. &sect; 310)), laws governing testimonials (including the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s Revised Endorsements and Testimonials Guides (16 CFR Part 255)), and/or any similar laws, laws relating to intellectual property, privacy, security, terrorism, corruption, child protection, or import/export laws. Affiliates are solely responsible for ensuring their compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and court orders of any kind of any jurisdiction applicable to you and your business, and any recipient to whom you send digital messages using our products or services. You have the responsibility to be aware of, understand, and comply with all applicable laws and ensure that you and all users of your account comply with such applicable laws at all times.<br>
                    If you use any messaging software, you agree that you will follow all applicable laws with respect to sending messages, including without limitation the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. You further agree to indemnify and defend OceanTrades from any claims, damages, losses, and lawsuits of any kind or nature that may be made or brought against OceanTrades relating in any way to your violation of law or third-party rights by use or misuse of any messaging software or hardware. You further understand and agree that OceanTrades has no control over, and therefore cannot be responsible for the functionality or failures of any third party software, including without limitation Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and internet browser notifications.<br>
                    In addition to the foregoing, OceanTrades requires you to follow these best practices when sending electronic communications:<br>
                    Use only permission-based marketing electronic communications lists (i.e., lists in which each recipient affirmatively opted-in to receiving those electronic communications).<br>
                    Always include a working &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; mechanism in each marketing electronic communication that allows the recipient to opt out from your mailing list (receipt/transactional messages that are exempt from &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; requirements of applicable law are exempt from this requirement).<br>
                    Comply with all requests from recipients to be removed from your mailing list within the earlier of ten (10) days of receipt of the request, or the deadline under applicable law.<br>
                    Maintain, publish, and comply with a privacy policy that meets all applicable legal requirements, whether or not you control the sending of the electronic communications, and include a link to such privacy policy in your electronic communications.<br>
                    Include in each electronic communication a link to your then-current privacy policy applicable to that electronic communication.<br>
                    Include in each electronic communication your valid physical mailing address or a link to that information.<br>
                    Do not send electronic communications to addresses obtained from purchased or rented lists.<br>
                    Do not use third party electronic addresses, domain names, or mail servers without proper permission from the third party.<br>
                    Do not routinely send electronic communications to non-specific addresses (e.g., webmaster@domain.com or info@domain.com).<br>
                    Do not engage in spamming.<br>
                    Do not disguise the origin, or subject matter of, any electronic communications or falsify or manipulate the originating message address, subject line, header, or transmission path information for any electronic communication.<br>
                    Do not send offers to obtain or attempt to obtain personal information, or generate leads, for third parties.<br>
                    Do not send &ldquo;chain letters,&rdquo; &ldquo;pyramid schemes,&rdquo; or other types of electronic messages that encourage the recipient to forward the content to strangers.<br>
                    Do not send to lists of addresses that are programmatically generated or scraped from the Internet.<br>
                    Do not employ sending practices, or have overall message delivery rates, which may cause harm to our services or other users of our services.<br>
                    Affiliates are independent contractors and are not employees or agents of OceanTrades. Affiliates have no authority to act on behalf of or bind OceanTrades. Affiliates shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all costs and other expenses incurred. Sections 18 and 20 below &ndash; in their entirety (as well as all other terms in this Agreement) &ndash; apply to Affiliates, and further govern the relationship between OceanTrades and each Affiliate.<br>

                    SECTION 13 &ndash; TESTIMONIALS, REVIEWS, AND PICTURES/VIDEOS<br>
                    OceanTrades is pleased to hear from users and customers and welcomes your comments regarding our services and products. OceanTrades may use testimonials and/or product reviews in whole or in part together with the name, city, and state of the person submitting it. Testimonials may be used for any form of activity relating to OceanTrades&rsquo;s services or products, in printed and online media, as OceanTrades determines in its sole and exclusive discretion. Testimonials represent the unique experience of the participants and customers submitting the testimonial, and do not necessarily reflect the experience that you may have using our services or products. As set forth above in Section 11, your results will vary depending upon a variety of factors unique to you and market forces beyond OceanTrades&rsquo;s control. Note that testimonials, photographs, and other information that you provide to us will be treated as non-confidential and nonproprietary, and, by providing them, you grant OceanTrades a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive and irrevocable license to use them.<br>
                    Additionally, OceanTrades reserves the right to correct grammatical and typing errors, to shorten testimonials prior to publication or use, and to review all testimonials prior to publication or use.

                    SECTION 15 &ndash; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES<br>
                    EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL OceanTrades OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, AND/OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOUR OR A THIRD PARTY&rsquo;S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SOFTWARE, SERVICE, OR PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OceanTrades HAS HAD NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS, OR CLAIMS. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES. THIS APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH DAMAGES ARE ALLEGEDLY CAUSED, AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE.<br>
                    IN NO EVENT SHALL OceanTrades&rsquo;S LIABILITY TO YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THREE (3) TIMES THE PAYMENTS PAID BY YOU TO OceanTrades FOR THE MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE IN WHICH THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM AGAINST OceanTrades OCCURRED OR TWO-THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.<br>
                    SECTION 16 &ndash; DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br>
                    If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at oceantradescommunity@gmail.com to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 19 and 20 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Utah County, Utah unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA&rsquo;s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or OceanTrades.<br>
                    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.<br>
                    The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Utah without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
                    You and OceanTrades agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and OceanTrades expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.<br>
                    Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).<br>
                    This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, as amended.<br>
                    This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with OceanTrades, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
                    YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.<br>
                    SECTION 17 &ndash; OceanTrades&rsquo;S ADDITIONAL REMEDIES<br>
                    In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to OceanTrades, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement or any infringement or threatened infringement by you of the intellectual property of OceanTrades or a third-party, OceanTrades shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Utah County, Utah restraining such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting OceanTrades from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Utah County, Utah for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts&rsquo; exclusive jurisdiction or venue.<br>

Sections 11, 13, 15 through 20, and 24 through 32 of this Agreement, as well as any representations, warranties, and other obligations made or undertaken by you, shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or your account or relationship with OceanTrades.<br>
                    Upon termination, you remain responsible for any outstanding payments to OceanTrades.<br>
                    SECTION 22 &ndash; NO WAIVER<br>
                    No failure or delay on the part of OceanTrades in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement may operate as a waiver, nor may any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or remedy, or the exercise of any other rights, power, or remedy under this Agreement. A waiver of any right or obligation under this Agreement shall only be effective if in writing and signed by OceanTrades.<br>
                    SECTION 23 &ndash; GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE<br>
                    This Agreement and any issue or dispute arising out of or otherwise related to this Agreement or your access to or use of the Website, our Privacy Policy, or any matter concerning OceanTrades, including your purchase and use or attempted use of any service or product, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of State of Utah without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. To the extent that any claim or dispute is found by the arbitrator or (if proper) a court of competent jurisdiction to be excluded from the arbitration agreement in Section 18 above, the parties agree any such claim or dispute shall be exclusively brought in and decided by the state or federal courts located in Utah County, Utah, and you hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, such courts, and forever waive any challenge to said courts&rsquo; exclusive jurisdiction or venue. All such claims must be brought on an individual and non-class, non-representative basis, and you forever waive any right to bring such claims on a class wide or representative basis.<br>
                    SECTION 24 &ndash; FORCE MAJEURE<br>
                    OceanTrades will not be responsible to you for any delay, damage, or failure caused or occasioned by any act of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.<br>
